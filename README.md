# üôç About me
I‚Äôve been programming for nearly 3 years, focusing primarily on frontend development and mastering JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js. I‚Äôve also explored backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB with Mongoose, and SQL, including setting up a backend for one of my more complex projects (NeXtPC). While I‚Äôm most comfortable crafting frontend interfaces, my basic backend skills with REST APIs and data management using SQL and MongoDB are a handy addition. I‚Äôm eager to keep growing as both a frontend and backend developer, taking on new challenges.
