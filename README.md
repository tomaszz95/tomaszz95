## üìï Projects

### Netflix Clone - Fully responsive website, which is an advanced clone of the popular streaming service Netflix, with many of its features.

The project is created in NextJS (13) using a small amount of React Redux, Firebase and written in Typescript.
The page is fully responsive - for mobiles, tablets and desktops. The app is 'cloning' the Netflix site - I used the tmdb database, which is not as detailed as the Netflix one. This means no videos, no detailed information about individual episodes of series, or other detailed data. The application contains many sub-pages, starting from the main view, through the whole process of logging in and registering, selecting a profile and editing it (some properties can be edited, others are blocked in this demo version), up to the main page of series, movies and individual sub-pages. Due to the nature of the app I used different icons, employed some dummy texts, and this is not a 'pixel perfect' clone - mainly due to a different api, which dictates a different placement of for example series and movie posters (netflix has them horizontally, tmdb vertically, also another data etc.).
The app is built with about 250 components (also some custom hooks, helpers, api fetching) and contains around 30 differens subpages (also dynamic ones with series and films data).

### Gradebook - An online app for students and teachers

An application that partially mimics the operation of an electronic gradebook. It allows you to check your schedule, your grades, statistics, and from the teacher's side to add news or new grades to a student. The project is created in NextJS (Typescript), using React Redux, Firebase, MongoDB. It combines frontend with backend and retrieving data from databases.
<br/>

#### To log in as a student you need to use the login dataset:

- login: student1@student.com ; password: student1

#### To log in as a teacher:

- login: teacher1@teacher.com ; password: teacher1

Student and teacher ID are not imposed in advance, just don't leave it empty.
