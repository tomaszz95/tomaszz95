## üôç About me
During the summer of 2021, I started to learn programming, beginning my journey with HTML and CSS, then training my knowledge in JavaScript, until now brushing up my skills in React and NextJS. Additionally, through my work as a surveyor, I have developed several soft skills universal for any industry ‚Äì such as teamwork, customer service, conscientiousness or attention to detail. My goal is to get a job as a Junior Frontend Developer. I am constantly developing my technical knowledge, and the soft skills I have acquired, as well as my character traits like ambition, eagerness for continuous self-development, analytical thinking and curiosity in problem-solving, have made the initial innocent learning of programming become my hobby and plan for the future.
