## üôç About me
I‚Äôve been learning programming for over two years, starting my journey with frontend development and mastering JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js. Over time, I‚Äôve expanded into backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose, enabling me to create fully functional applications. I have experience building both frontend interfaces and backend logic, integrating them with REST APIs and managing data with MongoDB. My goal is to continue developing my skills as a full-stack developer and take on more complex and challenging projects.

## üìï Projects

### Netflix Clone - A website that is a clone of Netflix ‚Äì it is fully responsive, with SEO and accessibility practices and with many features from the original streaming site.

The project is created in NextJS (13) using a small amount of React Redux, Firebase and written in Typescript. The page is fully responsive ‚Äì for mobiles, tablets and desktops. The app is cloning the Netflix site ‚Äì I used the TMDB database, which is not as detailed as the Netflix one. Therefore, detailed data such as videos and individual episode information is unavailable. The application contains various sub-pages, including the main view, login and registration processes, selecting a profile and editing it (not all properties can be edited), series and movies main pages and individual sub-pages. Due to the nature of the app, I used different icons, some dummy texts and it is not a pixel-perfect clone ‚Äì mainly because of the different API, which dictates a different placement of for example series and movie posters.

### Portfolio Page - A simple website briefly introducing me, the projects I have created and providing methods to contact me, along with the option to download my CV.

The site includes information about me, my projects and ways to contact me. It is not an overly complicated application, but clean, clear and comprehensive. The site is created in NextJs (14) using Typescript and Tailwind. Framer motion is a package used to animate the site. It consists of a homepage and three main subpages: about me, projects and contact. Additionally, each project has a separate subpage where you can find more detailed information and photos. Site is tested using JEST and RTL - more than 100 unit tests are written for most components of varying complexity.
