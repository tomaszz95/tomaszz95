## 📕 Projects

### Netflix Clone - A website that is a clone of Netflix – it is fully responsive, with SEO and accessibility practices and with many features from the original streaming site.

The project is created in NextJS (13) using a small amount of React Redux, Firebase and written in Typescript. The page is fully responsive – for mobiles, tablets and desktops. The app is cloning the Netflix site – I used the TMDB database, which is not as detailed as the Netflix one. Therefore, detailed data such as videos and individual episode information is unavailable. The application contains various sub-pages, including the main view, login and registration processes, selecting a profile and editing it (not all properties can be edited), series and movies main pages and individual sub-pages. Due to the nature of the app, I used different icons, some dummy texts and it is not a pixel-perfect clone – mainly because of the different API, which dictates a different placement of for example series and movie posters.

### Wordpress pages - Two websites created using Wordpress. One is a typical company website for a law firm created in Polish language, and the other is a small online shop for pet accessories.

First Website created using Wordpress and Gutenberg - in addition Astra was used as a theme. It is a fully functional and responsive web application that is a showcase for the law firm. Site is created in Polish language.

The website consists of five sub-pages. The main page, where all the advantages and incentives to use the law firm's services are briefly described. Then there are the 'about us' and 'team' sub-pages where, as the name suggests, the firm's history is described, clients are listed and team members are introduced. This is followed by a listing of services and an indication of how the process with the client will be carried out, ending with a 'contact us' sub-page where you can use the form to write to the firm.

The site includes information about me, my projects and ways to contact me. It is not an overly complicated application, but clean, clear and comprehensive. The site is created in NextJs (14) using Typescript and Tailwind. Framer motion is a package used to animate the site. It consists of a homepage and three main subpages: about me, projects and contact. Additionally, each project has a separate subpage where you can find more detailed information and photos. Site is tested using JEST and RTL - more than 100 unit tests are written for most components of varying complexity.

### Gradebook - An application that partly mimics the functioning of an electronic gradebook.

You can log in as either a teacher or a student. When you are logged as a student, you can check your timetable, grades, grade-related statistics, and information about other students/classes. As a teacher, you can also add news, assign grades to individual students and view statistics for the entire school (only two classes are available). It integrates frontend with backend and retrieving data from databases.
<br/>

#### To log in as a student you need to use the login dataset:

- login: student1@student.com ; password: student1

#### To log in as a teacher:

- login: teacher1@teacher.com ; password: teacher1
