## üôç About me
My programming journey began over two years ago. I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then ventured into React and its popular framework Next.js. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in this area. Additionally, I plan to learn backend technologies such as Node.js, Express, and possibly Java. At the moment I am an aspiring Junior Frontend Developer eager to get my first job and ultimately become a Fullstack Developer someday.
I am disciplined, ambitious, and ready to continuously improve my programming skills. I am interested in a long-term collaboration and job that allows me to contribute significantly to the company while enhancing my abilities. I can work under pressure, both as a part of the team and independently when necessary. Problem-solving and leveraging creativity are aspects of work that I particularly enjoy.

## üìï Projects

### Netflix Clone - A website that is a clone of Netflix ‚Äì it is fully responsive, with SEO and accessibility practices and with many features from the original streaming site.

The project is created in NextJS (13) using a small amount of React Redux, Firebase and written in Typescript. The page is fully responsive ‚Äì for mobiles, tablets and desktops. The app is cloning the Netflix site ‚Äì I used the TMDB database, which is not as detailed as the Netflix one. Therefore, detailed data such as videos and individual episode information is unavailable. The application contains various sub-pages, including the main view, login and registration processes, selecting a profile and editing it (not all properties can be edited), series and movies main pages and individual sub-pages. Due to the nature of the app, I used different icons, some dummy texts and it is not a pixel-perfect clone ‚Äì mainly because of the different API, which dictates a different placement of for example series and movie posters.

### Portfolio Page - A simple website briefly introducing me, the projects I have created and providing methods to contact me, along with the option to download my CV.

The site includes information about me, my projects and ways to contact me. It is not an overly complicated application, but clean, clear and comprehensive. The site is created in NextJs (14) using Typescript and Tailwind. Framer motion is a package used to animate the site. It consists of a homepage and three main subpages: about me, projects and contact. Additionally, each project has a separate subpage where you can find more detailed information and photos. Site is tested using JEST and RTL - more than 100 unit tests are written for most components of varying complexity.

### Gradebook - An application that partly mimics the functioning of an electronic gradebook.

You can log in as either a teacher or a student. When you are logged as a student, you can check your timetable, grades, grade-related statistics, and information about other students/classes. As a teacher, you can also add news, assign grades to individual students and view statistics for the entire school (only two classes are available). It integrates frontend with backend and retrieving data from databases.
<br/>

#### To log in as a student you need to use the login dataset:

- login: student1@student.com ; password: student1

#### To log in as a teacher:

- login: teacher1@teacher.com ; password: teacher1
